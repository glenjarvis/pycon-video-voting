BAyPIGgies Event 2020
---------------------

PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing
the open-source Python programming language. And, it's also a lot of fun!

However, because of the COVID-19 situation this year, we were not able to
attend in person.

Many of the speakers at PyCon have recorded their talks and they have been
posted by the PyCon organizers online. PyCon posts the talk videos every year
-- without hours or days after the talks have been given. The talks this year
are posted in the same locations.

But, isn't it funny how we need a little push - an event with our peers -- to
see what is available?

The Bay Area Python Interest Group (BAyPIGgies) will be hosting a PyCon 2020
watching party. We will, as a group, review all of the videos that are
available. And, then we will vote on the videos that interests us most.

We will watch two of those videos together. At the same time, we will have
break out sessions -- with different Zoom and Jitsu meeting rooms to ask
questions, discuss videos and have virtual Open Spaces.

Even though we are meeting online, it is important that we keep our Code of
Conduct in mind (https://baypiggies.net/pages/code_of_conduct.html). We need to
be Open, Considerate and Respectful. This is especially true in our Open
Spaces.
